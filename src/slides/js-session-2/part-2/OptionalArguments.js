      <p>
        JavaScript is extremely broad-minded about the number of arguments you
        can pass to a function. Pass too many, extra are ignored. Pass too few,
        the missing are set to undefined.
      </p>

      <p>
        Downside: You will likely pass the incorrect number of arguments to a
        function and not know it. JavaScript wonâ€™t give you an error or warning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upside: This can allow a function to be called with different numbers of
        arguments for broader usage.
      </p>

      <p>We can also set default arguments.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
function power(base, exponent = 2) {
  let result = 1;
  for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
    result *= base;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(power(4));
console.log(power(2, 6));
          `}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
